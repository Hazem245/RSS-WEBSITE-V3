<p>Across the globe there roughly 4200 religions, but the big religions are Islam, Christianity, Judaism, Hinduism, Buddhism and Sikhism. All of these 
religions share differnt beliefs and different Gods or maybe no Gods. With some conflicting ideas and beliefs 
there could be disagreements and could end in conflicts or even on a large scale,wars. There have been many wars caused religions from even 2000 years 
ago and we are going to show example of these:</p>

<p>The Battle of Badr, fought on Tuesday, 13 March 624 CE in the Hejaz region of western Arabia, was a key battle in the early days of
 Islam and a turning point in Muhammad's struggle with his opponents among the Quraish in Mecca.
 <br>
 <br>
 This Battle was aganist the Muslims (belivers of Allah) and the Quraish in Mecca who worshipped status and wanted
 this war to happen.  In 622 Muhammad and his followers had emigrated from Mecca to Medina. From his new base Muhammad began
 raiding Meccan caravan routes. This provoked the Meccan tribes into sending an army to confront Muhammad's Muslims.
 Despite the different sizes of armies with the Quraish having 1000 men, the outcome of this battle was a decisive Muslim victory and the start of Muslim-Quraish Wars. Battles like these were due to conglicting beliefs
 : One side believed in Allah and worshipped him; the other worshipped statues they made. </p></div>

<h2 style="position:relative; top:-675px; right:-0px; width:500px;height:325px">The Crusades(1095-1492)</h2>

</form>
<div class="conflict"  <div style= "position:relative; top:-985px; right:0px; width:400px;height:365px">
<p>The Crusades were a series of religious wars initiated, supported, and sometimes directed by the Latin Church in the medieval period. The term refers especially 
to the Eastern Mediterranean campaigns in the period between 1096 and 1271 that had the objective 
of recovering the Holy Land from Islamic rule.We are specifically looking at the period of Salah Al Din Al Ayyubi.
<br>
<br>
On July 4, 1187, the Muslim forces of Saladin (Salah al-Din) decisively defeated the crusader army south of the Horns of Hattin in Palestine, capturing Guy, king of Jerusalem; Reginald of Chatillon, Saladins enemy whom he personally killed; over two hundred Knights Hospitaller and Templar Knightly Orders whom he ordered to be killed; and many crusaders whom he ransomed.
 The remaining captured Christians were sold on the local slave markets. This crusade and battles were fought because differnet sides wanted to secure
 places they thought were holy to their religion becasue of their differnet beliefs.</p></div>

<h2 style="position:relative; top:-1325px; right:-0px; width:500px;height:325px">Thirty Years War(1618-1648)</h2>
</form>
<div class="conflict"  <div style= "position:relative; top:-1625px; right:0px; width:1300px;height:150px">
<p>The Thirty Years' War was fought from 1618 until 1648. Though it was primarily centered in Germany, several other 
countries became involved in the conflict, including France, Spain, and Sweden. In fact, almost all of the powerful
 countries in Europe were involved in the war. The battle was between Catholic and Protestant Christians across Europe.
 As a result of the Treaty of Westphalia, the Netherlands gained independence from Spain, 
 Sweden gained control of the Baltic and France was acknowledged as the preeminent Western power. 
 The power of the Holy Roman Emperor was broken and the German states were again able to determine 
 the religion of their lands.
 <br>
<br>
The war was instigated by the election of Ferdinand II as Holy Roman Emperor, a staunch Catholic who tried to impose religious uniformity on his domains. In response, 
the Protestant states of northern Germany formed the Protestant Union to defend their interests. This means religion is a very important 
lifestyle and can cause lots of conflicts.
